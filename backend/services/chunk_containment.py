chunk_containment.py — drop chunks whose xpath is a strict ancestor
of another chunk's xpath.

The chunker (backend/mapper/chunk_builder.py) walks bottom-up from
each content-bearing leaf until it either exceeds the char budget or
hits an "instance boundary" (the leaf's generalized pattern appears
more than once under the candidate frontier). Occasionally a seed
leaf belongs to a pattern that never repeats on its walk-up path, so
the walk steps all the way past the legitimate card/item boundary
and lands on a huge container that swallows every sibling card that
another walk already covered with a finer-grained chunk.

Empirically on a tarot.com love-reading index page we observed::

    #1 59235 bytes at /html/body/main/div/div/div[2]/div/div[2]   (MONSTER)
    #2  7673 bytes at /html/body/main/div/div/div[2]/div/div[1]
    #3..#22 ~2400 bytes each at
            /html/body/main/div/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/ul/li[i]/row/column[2]

The 59 KB monster is a strict xpath ancestor of the 20 per-card
chunks and contributes only redundant, context-exploding rollup.
Dropping it leaves the fine-grained per-card chunks intact.

This module exposes two pure helpers, :func:`is_ancestor_xpath` and
:func:`filter_redundant_rollups`. The filter is generic over any row
shape that carries an xpath — pass it ``ChunkInstanceRow`` lists for
the 3D projector fit, :class:`InstanceHit` lists for search
retrieval, and :class:`Chunk` lists for post-build persistence, so
all three stay consistent.

    The caller supplies ``xpath_of`` so this works on any row-shape —
    ``ChunkInstanceRow``, :class:`~backend.services.chunk_retrieval.InstanceHit`,
    projector node dicts, or :class:`~backend.mapper.chunk_builder.Chunk`.
    Input order is preserved for the survivors.

    Size gate (important for not eating legitimate coarse chunks):
        When ``size_of`` is provided, an ancestor is dropped **only if**
        its size is strictly greater than ``min_rollup_size``. In
        practice we set ``min_rollup_size`` to the chunker's hard
        char ceiling — so a 400-char card chunk containing a 200-char
        title chunk is NOT pruned (both are legitimate finer/coarser
        views under budget), but the 59 KB monster rollup that
        empirically triggered this whole pass IS pruned. The default
        of 0 preserves the original "always drop ancestors" behavior.

    Implementation: sort indices by xpath lex order (ancestors precede
    descendants), then for each sorted xpath do a bounded forward scan
    checking whether any later xpath shares its prefix + ``/``. Worst
    case O(N log N + N·max_family_size); for realistic N (<1000) this
    is effectively linear.
